I treat this directory as my private / personal archive notebook about asm2bf.
It contains some files regarding my thought process while implementing changes.

Most of these are of no use to other people, mostly because the notes have been
taken in a chaotic manner. They're encrypted, I may one day move them out of this
repository, but for now, they're staying here.

Once again - I'm certain they're of _no use_ to you. If they would be useful in
any way, I'd publish them already. Like I did with the manual, for example.
