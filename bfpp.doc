bfpp is a asm2bf preprocessor based on gcc -E.

It behaves just like normally, but the first line is being cut to get rid of shebang that will
be eventually parsed by gcc and bail out. Also, the includes are tweaked so the lib/ and .
directories are added to the include path.

All the lines containing hash (#) from output are stripped later by the following sed program:

sed '/^#/ d' < "$1.i" > "$1.p"

The shebang is removed using following snippet:

cat "$1" | sed -e "1!b" -e '/#/d'

Stray files might be left over if the program is used incorrectly. Please refer to examples/
example-*.asm.

bfpp is usually glued together with bfmake for usage simplicity.
