bfpp is a asm2bf preprocessor based on Lua.
All the lines starting with hash (#), are executed as Lua code during compile-time.
To embed the value of an expression to an arbitrary place in your code, you can use $() syntax.
Lua makes it really easy to make rich compile-time macros simplifying software development
using asm2bf.

The foundation macros are being written.
