Please note that i am NOT going to describe Brainfuck programming step by step.

Interpreter specification:
 * Possibly infinite memory cell amount support
 * Loading code of arbitrary size
 * Returning 0 on EOF
 * Written in portable C89
 * Around 120 SLOC

NOTE: bfi DOES NOT WORK with RLE variant of brainfuck. Please decompress the code beforehand.

Historical - .bck file contents:

BFI is simple brainfuck intepreter designed to work along with BFAsm.
Please note that it fullfills all requirements of assembler mentioned above.

It's non-optimizing version. Oleg Mazonka's brainfuck interpreter (faster than mine)
should also do the trick.
