bfmake will preprocess and assemble given program. It's intended to be used inside files as a
shebang.

First step in building is passing the program thru bfpp. Then, everything is assembled and 
temporary files are mostly removed.

There isn't very much going on about bfmake, please refer to examples/example-*.asm to check out
it's practical use.
