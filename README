The only true brainfuck assembler. Produces quite small brainfuck code if you're able to optimize the assembly.
With C preprocessor wired up, named labels and all the features you'd expect from a normal assembly, it's ready
for your use. The standard library is currently being constructed and you may contribute to make it even better.
Floating point support is being planned and worked on. Please refer to doc/ for detailed documentation.
