asmbf

The only true brainfuck assembler. Produces quite small brainfuck code if you're
able to optimize the assembly. With C preprocessor wired up, named labels and all the features
you'd expect from a normal assembly, it's ready for your use.

The standard library is currently being constructed and you may contribute to make it even
better ;). Floating point support is being planned and worked on. Please refer to doc/ for detailed
documentation.
