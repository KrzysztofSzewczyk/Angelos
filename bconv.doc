BCONV is using ready-to-go snippets to generate the code required. You can study them yourself, but the very important thing
that you might need to note is the fact that the program will require six times up to eight times as much of memory as it used
before, and it might run three to nine times slower than before.

The I/O might be biased, so my general advice is avoiding to print numbers larger than a single cell (you could theoretically
assume that you can print 16-bit numbers, as the specification says so, but it's recommended to stick to printing out
just ASCII in any case as a rule of thumb).
