Instructions:

1. Put project files into <apache>/src/modules, where <apache> is the
   directory that contains the sources of apache.
2. Add the following line to the end of the <apache>/src/Configuration file:
   AddModule modules/bf/bfmod.o
3. Rename bfmod-makefile to Makefile.tmpl 
4. Now cd into <apache>/src and run './Configure'. This should create a Makefile
   in <apache>/src/modules/bf.
5. Now you can proceed with the apache installation just as you normally would, just
   adding the following
   --activate-module=src/modules/bf/libbf.a
   when calling './configure'.

In order to be able to use bfmod, you have to create .htaccess in the newly created directory. Edit this file to contain the same
line as above 'AddHandler bf-handler .bf'. This will pass all requests on files with the extension .bf that are located in the
directory to mod_bf. It should be noted that you might just as well add the above line to a .htaccess in any other directory.
